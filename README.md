# IMU Data Generation

## Overview

This repository provides tools and resources for generating simulated or collecting real-world IMU data. IMU data is crucial for applications like robotics, virtual reality, and motion tracking.

## Contents

1. **Simulation:**
   - Simulate IMU data for testing and development.
   - Define motion scenarios and apply physics equations.
   - Add noise for real-world conditions.

2. **Data Collection:**
   - Connect physical IMU sensors to microcontrollers or computers.
   - Capture real-world motion data for analysis.

3. **Data Fusion:**
   - Implement algorithms for combining accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer data.
   - Enhance accuracy using techniques like Kalman filtering.

4. **Calibration:**
   - Calibrate sensors to eliminate biases and improve accuracy.
   - Handle noise reduction for cleaner data.

5. **Timestamping:**
   - Ensure accurate timestamping of each data point.
   - Use high-resolution clocks or synchronize with external time sources.

6. **Data Logging:**
   - Store generated or collected data in CSV, JSON, or other suitable formats.
   - Include scripts for easy data logging during experiments.

7. **Visualization:**
   - Use visualization tools to plot and analyze IMU data.
   - 3D visualization for motion understanding.

## Getting Started

1. **Requirements:**
